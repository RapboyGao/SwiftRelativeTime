A lightweight Swift library for displaying relative time in a human-readable format. Convert dates to friendly strings like "just now", "5 minutes ago", or "3 days from now".

**[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RapboyGao/SwiftRelativeTime.git)**

## Features

- Convert dates to human-readable relative time strings
- Support for both past and future time references
- Comprehensive time unit support: seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, and years
- Built-in internationalization support
- Swift 6.0 compatible
- Cross-platform support (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS)

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the package to your `Package.swift` file or through Xcode:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/RapboyGao/SwiftRelativeTime.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Then add the dependency to your target:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: ["SwiftRelativeTime"]
    )
]
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```swift
import SwiftRelativeTime

// Create a date from the past
let pastDate = Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: -3600) // 1 hour ago
let relativeTime = SwiftRelativeTime(pastDate)
print(relativeTime) // "An hour ago"

// Create a date for the future
let futureDate = Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 86400) // 1 day from now
let futureRelativeTime = SwiftRelativeTime(futureDate)
print(futureRelativeTime) // "In a day"
```

### Custom Reference Date

You can also specify a custom reference date (defaults to current date):

```swift
let someDate = Date()
let referenceDate = Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 7200) // 2 hours from now
let relativeTime = SwiftRelativeTime(someDate, now: referenceDate)
```

## Internationalization

SwiftRelativeTime is fully internationalized using Swift's standard `NSLocalizedString`. The default localization is English.

To add support for additional languages:

1. Create a new `.strings` file in your project
2. Copy all the string keys from the library (you can access them via `I18n.allStringKeys`)
3. Translate the values to your target language
4. Ensure the file is properly included in your app bundle with the correct locale identifier
